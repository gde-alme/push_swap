# push_swap  
This implementation can solve the push_swap project with very few moves while also  
accepting any type of input as long as all diferent numbers are between INT_MAX & INT_MIN.  
  
# USAGE  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gde-alme/push_swap.git

make
./push_swap 505034 23 230102 3 23 1 42 4 2 31
